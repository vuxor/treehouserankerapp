# The Treehouse Ranker App
This is an application that allows users to look-up a treehouse user and see what their "Market Value" is.

This app is simple... A user enters in their Treehouse Username (or one on someone that they know). Then it takes
the users points data and then tells the user their market value.

//As of right now, this program is built on AngularJS and since it is a simple application, it only has one controller.


# WELCOME CHANGES

I would like to fix the content
I would like to fix the styling of the page (adding some graphics)
Finally, I would like to add some animated transitions.

I will also be adding another section of the app that checks the user's business knowledge.
